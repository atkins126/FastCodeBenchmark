# FastCode Benchmark 

Currently, just two of the benchmark programs are adapted to be compiled by recent versions of Delphi into a 64-bit executable:

 - MemoryManagerBV201\FastcodeMMChallengeBV.dpr
 - FillCharBV163\FillCharBV.dpr

The rest of the benchmark programs are existing FastCode programs that can only be compiled to a 32-bit executable by Delphi version up to 2007.
