FastCode Memory Manager B&V 1.1.1 - 11-Jan-2005

Removed Validate29.  This may be added back at a later time.
Run validations and benchmarks with slightly different compiler settings.  This means that twice as many copies of FastcodeMMChallengeBV are built.
 - Validations have Range and Overflow checking turned on.
 - Benchmarks have Range and Overflow checking turned off.
After every successful write of the XML log file, a backup is made.  This way, if an out of memory error leaves you with a zero byte file, you can recover up to the previous successful test.
